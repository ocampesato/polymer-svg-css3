polymer-svg-css3
================

Graphics and animation based on Polymer, SVG, and CSS3 that combine some CSS3-based effects in the css3-graphics repository with the Polymer and SVG code samples in the polymer-svg repository.

After downloading the code samples as well as installing bower on your machine, run this command:
bower install

The preceding command will install the dependencies for the code samples.

A few details:
1) the initial commit exceeded 1,000 files so I had to create shell scripts to determine the extra CSS3 files that are not needed in these code samples and then remove those CSS3 files (so everything should work correctly).
2) these code samples are intended for entertainment, and they do not necessarily contain "best practices", nor are they intended for a production website
